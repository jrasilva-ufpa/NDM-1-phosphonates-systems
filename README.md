# NDM-1-phosphonates-systems

🧬 NDM-1 + Phosphonate Inhibitor Systems (AMBER Input Files)

This repository contains the ready-to-run topology and coordinate files used in the molecular dynamics simulations described in the manuscript: “Structural and Mechanistic Insights into Noncovalent Inhibition of NDM-1 by Heteroaryl Phosphonates” submitted to RSC Advances.

📦 Contents of the Repository

For each NDM-1–inhibitor system, the following files are provided:

com_solv.parm7 – AMBER topology file (parameter file)

com_solv.rst7 – AMBER coordinate file (initial structure)

com_solv.pdb – PDB format file (for visualization)

Folders are named according to the ligand used (e.g., C01/, C02/, ..., C14/, and apo/ for the ligand-free system).

These files represent the fully solvated and neutralized systems, ready for minimization, equilibration, and production runs in AMBER (e.g., using pmemd.cuda or sander).
